## Current Features

This project currently features a transmitter with a Pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) generator. Current supported line codes include Polar NRZ.

</p>

The transmitter can also calculate the Autocorrelation Function using MATLAB's xcorr function. The Power Spectral Density of the Polar NRZ PRBS can be calculated using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem by applying FFT.
